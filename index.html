<!-- I am also enthusiastic about involvement in the business area. I studied areas outside of engineering, law, business management, diplomacy, and psychology when I was an undergraduate. Studying law was in-depth for pursuing the patent agent test, but I stopped the study in the interim to continue the study in engineering. I also eagerly participated in an English debating club as a president, where many talented lawyers and consultants have passed. Based on this experience, I'm also interested in combining my knowledge of engineering in the business area, for example, a start-up or global management consulting.</p> -->

                            <p> The adoption of smartwatches for daily blood pressure (BP) monitoring has surged, driven by the promise of continuous health tracking. Yet, the accuracy of smartwatch-derived BP readings compared to traditional cuff-based measurements remains under scrutiny. In a pioneering effort, Youngro Lee, in collaboration with the Korean Hypertension Society, has performed statistical analyses tailored to evaluate smartwatch-based BP data. Since 2021, annual campaigns have been launched to collect such data, with Lee at the forefront of developing innovative methodologies for its validation and assessment. A key focus of Lee’s research has been the calibration process's role in maintaining the accuracy of BP estimates. Utilizing the Linear Mixed Effect Model, his work has shed light on the calibration's durability, as evidenced by his publication in Hypertension Research (2023), which earned him the Young Investigator Award in 2023. Further, Lee proposed a standard, termed 'calibration difference,' to gauge calibration stability and identify factors affecting it, a study detailed in his presentations at EMBC 2023 and IEEE OJEMB 2024. Currently, Lee is authoring a paper exploring the impact of body composition on smartwatch-based BP estimates. His research is expanding to include guidelines for measurement periods tailored to individual demographics and the analysis of measurement accuracy as influenced by calibration timing and measurement instances.</p>

<!--                             <p>Blood pressure estimation using smartwatches has become a popular tool for daily blood pressure monitoring. In collaboration with the Korean Hypertension Society, Youngro Lee conducted a statistical analysis of blood pressure measurements in two different years: 2021 with 760 people, and 2022 with 323 people. The main focus of the study was to investigate the role of calibration in blood pressure measurements. Using Linear Mixed Effect Models and Generalized Linear Models, Youngro investigated the impact of days after calibration on blood pressure values and the factors influencing the difference between blood pressure measurements taken after and before calibration. The results of the study were published in prestigious scientific journals, including Hypertension Research and the International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. In recognition of his outstanding work, Youngro was awarded as the young investigator by the Korean Hypertension Society. With the collaboration of Korean Hypertension Society and Samsung Electronics, the campaign for collecting the dataset and the further research is still ongoing in 2023. </p>

                            <p>Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) present major public health challenges, causing significant economic and societal impact during their peak seasons in winter and early spring. In response to the urgent need for preliminary assessment tools for parents and decision-support tools for healthcare professionals, Youngro Lee, in collaboration with the Pediatric School of Korea University, pioneered the development of a machine learning model to predict influenza and RSV infections. This model leverages basic demographic information, health records, symptomatology, and breath sounds from young children who visited the hospital across two periods: 2015-2016 and 2018-2019. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, the model was developed in two phases: 1) the House model, designed for initial assessment by parents at home, and 2) the Hospital model, intended to aid professionals in clinical settings. The models demonstrated promising results in both stages and diseases. Significantly, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was utilized to illuminate the decision-making criteria of the model, providing transparent and interpretable predictions. Furthermore, Lee established a macro system for the continuous real-time collection of new data in a hospital. As of 2024, Lee is actively working with collaborators to document these findings in a comprehensive paper. Additionally, efforts are underway to gather data from various hospitals, aiming to further validate the model's effectiveness across diverse settings. </p>

                            <p>Leveraging microbial data for disease biomarker identification, particularly in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), presents notable challenges due to vast phenotypes and limited sample sizes. Youngro Lee made strides in this area through two distinct approaches: Machine Learning-Based Feature Selection: Lee enhanced the stability of microbial biomarker identification by integrating the Bray-Curtis similarity matrix with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). This innovative combination not only preserved but, in some cases, improved the performance of biomarker discovery, as detailed in a publication in Gigascience, 2023. Novel Biomarker Selection via SHAP-Based Binarization: Addressing the issue of overfitting in small-sample microbial datasets, Lee proposed a method to binarize microbial data using SHAP values. This approach, designed to optimize binarization standards, significantly boosted both the performance and reliability of biomarker identification. Currently, Lee is advancing this research by preparing a paper on the SHAP-based binarization method, collaborating with experts to further validate these methodologies' effectiveness.</p>

                            <p>Feature importance is commonly used in medical fields to define risk indicators or biomarkers for diseases. However, the validity of feature importance is not often studied. Youngro Lee suggests investigating the validity of feature importance in low-performing machine learning models and how performance affects its validity. Lee designed the aggravating factors of the machine learning model into two categories: lack of data samples and lack of features. By controlling these two factors independently to decrease the model's performance, the pattern of feature importance values was studied. Lee found that the factor influences the validity of feature importance, not just performance. Lee and collaborators are currently working on submitting a paper on this topic.</p>
