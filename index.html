<!-- I am also enthusiastic about involvement in the business area. I studied areas outside of engineering, law, business management, diplomacy, and psychology when I was an undergraduate. Studying law was in-depth for pursuing the patent agent test, but I stopped the study in the interim to continue the study in engineering. I also eagerly participated in an English debating club as a president, where many talented lawyers and consultants have passed. Based on this experience, I'm also interested in combining my knowledge of engineering in the business area, for example, a start-up or global management consulting.</p> -->

                            <p> Watch-based blood pressure (BP) estimation holds great potential due to its convenience and low cost but faces challenges in accuracy and validation. Through annual campaigns organized by the Korean Hypertension Society, a large dataset of BP values measured by Galaxy Watch has been collected. As a lead researcher, Lee has contributed to the following tasks: 1) Analyzing statistical patterns within the data,
2) Designing a validity index applicable to watch-based BP monitoring and identifying factors affecting stability, and 3)Developing a post-processing method to enhance accuracy efficiently. </p>

<!--                             <p>Blood pressure estimation using smartwatches has become a popular tool for daily blood pressure monitoring. In collaboration with the Korean Hypertension Society, Youngro Lee conducted a statistical analysis of blood pressure measurements in two different years: 2021 with 760 people, and 2022 with 323 people. The main focus of the study was to investigate the role of calibration in blood pressure measurements. Using Linear Mixed Effect Models and Generalized Linear Models, Youngro investigated the impact of days after calibration on blood pressure values and the factors influencing the difference between blood pressure measurements taken after and before calibration. The results of the study were published in prestigious scientific journals, including Hypertension Research and the International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. In recognition of his outstanding work, Youngro was awarded as the young investigator by the Korean Hypertension Society. With the collaboration of Korean Hypertension Society and Samsung Electronics, the campaign for collecting the dataset and the further research is still ongoing in 2023. </p>

                            <p>Influenza-like illnesses pose significant public health challenges, resulting in substantial economic and societal impacts. To address these issues, a machine learning-based decision-support system was developed as a preliminary assessment tool for parents and doctors. Lee played a key role in this project by developing the optimal machine learning model and validating its results using interpretability methods. Additionally, he contributed to building a macro system for real-time data collection and prediction in a hospital setting.</p>

                            <p>Leveraging microbial data for disease biomarker identification, particularly in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), introduces the challenge of dimensionality due to the vast range of phenotypes and limited sample sizes. To extract essential information from microbial data, two distinctive approaches have been studied: 1) Applying Bray-Curtis similarity-based mapping transformation for feature selection, and 2) Using SHAP-based feature binarization to compress the abundance metrics of each taxonomy. Both approaches have proven effective in achieving more stable biomarker selection while maintaining or even improving the performance of the machine learning model.</p>

                            <p>Feature importance is widely used in various application fields to define risk indicators or biomarkers for specific targets. However, its validity is often evaluated solely based on the performance of machine learning models at the application level, which can be limiting. Two distinctive studies have been conducted on this topic: 1) Analyzing the relationship between model performance and the validity of feature importance, and 2) Developing a Python library that summarizes statistical analyses of SHAP values, emphasizing statistically valid results.</p>
